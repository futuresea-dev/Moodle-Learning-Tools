# Learning Tools
Learning Tools provides the learner with a set of useful tools, like bookmarks or notes.Â 

# Requirements
This plugin requires Moodle 3.9+

# Motivation for this plugin
This plugin was built to help students to improve the user experience of students "working"/"learning" in moodle by providing tools that users are used to from modern platforms.

# Installation
Install the plugin like any other plugin to folder /local/learningtools
See http://docs.moodle.org/en/Installing_plugins for details on installing Moodle plugins

# Initial Configuration
After installing the plugin, it is ready to use without the need for any configuration.

# Theme support
This plugin is developed and tested on Moodle Core's Boost theme. It should also work with Boost child themes, including Moodle Core's Classic theme. However, we can't support any other theme than Boost.

# Plugin repositories
This plugin will be published and regularly updated in the Moodle plugins repository: https://moodle.org/plugins/local_learningtools
The latest development version can be found on Github: [https://github.com/bdecentgmbh/moodle-local_learningtools/](https://github.com/futuresea-dev/Moodle-Learning-Tools.git)

# Bug and problem reports / Support requests
This plugin is carefully developed and thoroughly tested, but bugs and problems can always appear.
Please report bugs and problems on Github: [https://github.com/bdecentgmbh/moodle-local_learningtools/issues](https://github.com/futuresea-dev/Moodle-Learning-Tools/issues)
We will do our best to solve your problems, but please note that due to limited resources we can't always provide per-case support.

# Moodle release support
This plugin is maintained for the two most recent major releases of Moodle as well as the most recent LTS release of Moodle.
If you are running a legacy version of Moodle, but want or need to run the latest version of this plugin, you can get the latest version of the plugin, remove the line starting with $plugin->requires from version.php and use this latest plugin version then on your legacy Moodle. However, please note that you will run this setup completely at your own risk. We can't support this approach in any way and there is an undeniable risk for erratic behavior.

# Translating this plugin
This Moodle plugin is shipped with an english language pack only. All translations into other languages must be managed through AMOS (https://lang.moodle.org) by what they will become part of Moodle's official language pack.
